# WSharp (pronounced "dub Sharp")
A Whenever compiler written in C#. You can learn more about the language [here](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/whenever.html). Granted, the amount of documentation around the language is ... sparce, so a fair amount of what I've done is open to interpretation. But I've found Whenever to be a fun, weird programming language where any line can execute and yet you can still write programs like "99 bottles of beer on the wall".

If you'd like to compile Whenever programs, navigate to the `Samples\Playground` directory, and run:
```
dotnet run
```
This will compile whatever is in `Playground.ws`. At some point, the compilation process will get "better" but that's what works for now.

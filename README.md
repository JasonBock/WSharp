# WSharp (pronounced "dub Sharp")
A Whenever compiler written in C#. You can learn more about the language [here](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/whenever.html).

If you'd like to compile Whenever programs, navigate to the `Samples\Playground` directory, and run:
```
dotnet run
```
This will compile whatever is in `Playground.ws`. At some point, the compilation process will get "better" but that's what works for now.
